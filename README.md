# Submission-Assessment
Its contents :
* Part 1

* Part 2

* Part 3

Notes regarding Part 1 :
* I provided 2 datasets, 1 code.py for python code, and app.py for flask app
* In the files there are comments illustrate everything.
* In the APP flask :
    * you can now test your /top_employees and /employees_in_department endpoints using various tools, For example like curl.
    * the answers will return as json format
    * you can use these curl for two endpoints when you try to test :
        * To get the top N highest-paid employees, you can make a GET request to the /top_employees endpoint with the optional parameter N.
        * curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/top_employees?N=3".  Just write this http://127.0.0.1:5000/top_employees?N=3 in the URL (You can choose any number not just 3 of course)
        * To get the number of employees in a specific department, you need to provide the X parameter.
        * curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees_in_department?X=Finance"  The same as point 2.
