# Submission-Assessment
Its contents :
* Part 1: Programming and Analysis (Python)

* Part 2: Statistical Analysis

* Part 3: Data Visualization

* Readme file

* Notebook for all coding tasks, but API App (because it must be locally)  - it's additional
  
Notes regarding Part 1 :
* You can see the code for part 1.1, part 1.2 in one file called 1.1, 1.2 Code.py.
* I provided the dataset that used in API App, in case you want to run the api app first or before the code.py.
* At the end of API APP.py ( flask ) you will see the comments to illustrate you how to test the endpoints using curl. 

Notes regarding Part 2 :
* In the code.py file, you will find the model with metrics, and there is a final block. I made it as a comment, but if you want to predict new prices for any house, just uncomment it, and it will run successfully. It will asks you for information about your house, which you need to predict its price and it will give you the predicted price.

Notes regarding Part 3 :
* you can see attched output

## Technologies i used
* Python (Libraries)
* PowerBI
